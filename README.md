### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to enhance employee performance and reduce the attrition rate by creating the HR analytics dashboard of XYZ Company. The dashboard provides valuable insights into attrition trends and the factors influencing attrition within the company, utilizing employee data. These insights empower data-driven decision-making to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

### Data Source
The dataset utilized for this analysis was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika2301/hr-analytics-dataset?select=HR_Analytics.csv)

### Tools
Power BI : Data cleaning, data analysis and dashboard creation.

### Data Cleaning Process
Removed null values and duplicates from the dataset. Spelling errors were detected and rectified. A conditional column was added to the attrition column, assigning a value of 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no'. A new measure was also created to calculate the attrition rate, obtained by dividing the total attrition count by the total employee count.

### Questions
1. What is the total count of employees in the company?
2. What is the average salary across different departments?
3. What is the average age of employees in the company?
4. What is the attrition count and attrition rate in the company?
5. What are the attrition trends among different age groups?
6. What is the average tenure of employees in the company?
7. How does attrition differ between genders?
8. What is the attrition rate based on the education level of employees?
9. What are the attrition trends among different age groups?
10. How does attrition vary based on job satisfaction levels and roles?
11. What are the attrition patterns observed within different salary slabs?
12. Visualize the attrition count trends and the salary hike percentage.
13. What are the attrition trends concerning the years of employee service at the company?

### Findings
The XYZ Company currently has 1470 employees with an average age of 37 and an average salary of 6.5K. The average tenure of employees is seven years. There is a notable concern regarding the 16.1% attrition rate, leading to 237 employees leaving the company. The attrition rate varies across departments, with the Research and Development department experiencing the highest rate. Males exhibited a higher attrition rate, with 150 leaving the company. Younger age groups, particularly those between 26-35 years, and those with salaries up to 5K, are more likely to leave, especially within the first years of employment. Additionally, job satisfaction levels and job role correlate with attrition rates, as employees working as laboratory technician and sales executive exhibit higher attrition rates. Furthermore, employees who receive salary hikes of 11% are more likely to leave the company

### Summary
XYZ Company has high attrition rates, especially in departments like Research and development and among younger employees. HR data analysis has shown that attrition is affected by various factors, including department, age group, gender, salary level, and job satisfaction. By addressing these factors, XYZ Company can lower the attrition rate and cultivate a positive work environment for its employees.
